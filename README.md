# Criminal-Identification-Using-Facial-Recognition

The project is about identifying criminals based on the images of a dataset. I have used LFW dataset for this project. 
The objective of this project is to identify a criminal based on face recognition and if a face is recognized, an automated email should be sent to concerned authority. 
Image of the recognized will also be attached to the email.
